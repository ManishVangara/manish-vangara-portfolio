RESUME FILE INSTRUCTIONS
========================

Please add your resume PDF file to this directory with the name "resume.pdf"

The download button in the hero section is already configured to download:
./assets/resume.pdf

To add your resume:
1. Save your resume as a PDF file
2. Rename it to "resume.pdf"
3. Place it in this assets/ directory

The download button will automatically work once the file is present!

Note: The download animation will still work even if the PDF is not present,
but users will see a browser error. Make sure to add your actual resume.pdf file.
